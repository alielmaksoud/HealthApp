# Health/Fitness App

This repository contains code for an interactive web app, utilizing BootStrap and React to help users track fitness and health goals. The Nutritionix API allows for users to utilize natural language input to see how many calories they are burning for their exercises. 

To visit the app as it is being implemented utilizing React, visit this link: https://rayz2007.github.io/HealthApp/.

The code is currently being worked on to utilize React, to see a basic working version made with regular JavaScript, visit this link: https://rayz2007.github.io/HealthPlainJS/.
